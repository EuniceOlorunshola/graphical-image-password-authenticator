# What is a Graphical Image Password Authenticator? 
A graphical password authenticator is a form of authentication using images rather than letters, digits, or special characters. It is user- friendly and may be more secure.

# Why use a Graphical Image Password Authenticator?

Most modern websites and apps require an account to use their services, accounts they need some sort of authentication--usually a password. 
Most passwords are text based, and in order to make them unique and less guessable, most services impose password requirements such as a certain length, numbers, 
upper or lowercase letter, or special characters. However, most people do the bare minimum of these requirements, resulting in simple and easy to guess passwords 
and compromising the security of their account. However, if a graphical image password is used--the password remains simple, only requiring a user to remember images rather than different letters and characters, and with a large enough image bank, can provide an immense amount of different possible password combinations, 
making them harder to guess, while still being easy to remember for those who chose their password.
Our product offers the solutions to these weaknesses by providing a graphical passoword authentication.

# What is our purpose of creating a Graphical Image Password Authenticator?

Our purpose was to implement an authentication system that works by having the user select from images , in a specific order, presented in graphical user interface, and also for those that wish to proide a more user friendly , convenient and just as, if not more secure, password system. 
Sucessfully register and authenticate users which is  performed by having users initially create a username of their liking, 
choosing a 5 image sequence. These credentials are then stored in a secure password database which the server can query to compare any further login attempts. 
When logging on, a set of images included the ones from the password will be randomly generated and ordered. 
The user must choose the correct images in the correct order for them to log in.

# Who is our target audience for our Graphical Image Password Authenticator?

We based the target audience of our product to companies that store a large amount of users and want to have a more user-friendly interface for its users. 
Because our product uses a graphical user interface, it can be more secure than using text passwords. 
The extra layer of security may be attractive for companies that want that extra security.
